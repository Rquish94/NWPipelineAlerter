# NWPipelineAlerter
This script is built to sit within a NetWitness pipeline (json) constantly looking for events to alert on. Once an alert has been triggered, the script will use the information gathered in the pipeline and query a database for more information including the address to alert. The templates of the alerts are dynamic and are sent via email..
