# NWPipelineAlerter
This script is build to sit within a NetWitness pipeline (json) constantly looking for events to alert on. Once an alert has been triggered, the script will use the information gathered by the alert and query a database for more information including on the address to alert to. The templates of the alerts are dynamic and are sent via email..
